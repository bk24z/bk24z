👨🏾‍💻 My name is Bradley Austin, and I go by bk24z on most platforms.<br>
🎓 I am a first year Computer Science student at The University of Edinburgh.<br>
🔭 I’m currently working on a motion/camera controlled bowling game for the Edinburgh Makerspace Student Technician Award.<br>
🌱 I’m currently taking the time to refine my skills in Python and explore other languages/frameworks.<br>
🤔 I’m interested in frontend/backend/mobile dev, AI, ML and potentially cybersecurity. I am yet to find my niche, and trying to develop my skills in all of these areas so that I can make an informed decision.

### 💪🏾 My Skills

Python - what I mainly develop with<br>
Swift/SwiftUI - I have some experience in building SwiftUI apps<br>
Raspberry Pi and other hardware - I have used these in some of the projects I have worked on
