## 👋🏾 Hi, I'm Bradley!

<!--Image here-->

- 👨🏾‍💻 My name is Bradley Austin, and I go by bk24z on most platforms.
- 🎓 I am a first year Computer Science student at The University of Edinburgh.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a motion/camera controlled bowling game for the Edinburgh Makerspace Student Technician Award.
- 🌱 I’m currently taking the time to refine my skills in Python and explore other languages/frameworks.
- 🤔 I’m interested in frontend/backend/mobile dev, AI, ML and potentially cybersecurity. I am yet to find my niche, and trying to develop my skills in all of these areas so that I can make an informed decision.
